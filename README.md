# PencePoint 🪙

PencePoint is a high-quality, offline-first Point of Sale (POS) sample application. It focuses on **Clean Architecture**, **Financial Precision**, and a modern **Declarative UI**.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Financial Precision**: Money is treated as a first-class citizen using a custom `Money` value object. Amounts are stored as `Long` (pence) to avoid floating-point errors common in financial applications.
- **Offline-First**: Implements a robust caching strategy using Room. The application remains functional without an active internet connection by serving data from a local database with a configurable cache timeout.
- **Tax Calculation**: Implements granular tax logic rounded at the `BasketItem` level (Half-Up) to ensure accuracy in multi-item transactions.
- **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns between `Domain`, `Data`, and `Presentation` layers to ensure testability and maintainability.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Leveraging the latest stable Android tools including Kotlin 2.0, Compose, Hilt with KSP, and Room.
- **Type-Safe Navigation**: Uses the modern Compose Navigation (v2.8.5) with Kotlin Serialization for compile-time safety across screens.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose (Declarative UI) with Material 3
- **Image Loading**: Coil (Optimized for Compose)
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt with KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)
- **Navigation**: Type-safe Navigation Compose with Kotlin Serialization
- **Networking**: Retrofit & OkHttp with FakeStore API integration
- **Persistence**: Room Database (Offline-first caching strategy)
- **Async**: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Architecture**: MVI/MVVM with Clean Architecture
- **Build System**: Gradle Kotlin DSL with Version Catalogs (`libs.versions.toml`)

## 💰 Financial Implementation Details

### The `Money` Class
Instead of `Double` or `Float`, we use a dedicated `Money` data class:
```kotlin
data class Money(
    val amountInPence: Long,
    val currencyCode: String = "GBP"
)
```
This ensures that `0.1 + 0.2` always equals `0.3`, preventing the precision issues inherent in IEEE 754 floating-point math.

### Tax Logic
Taxes are calculated per category (e.g., Electronics: 15%, Food: 5%) and are provided by a `TaxProvider`. Rounding follows the `HALF_UP` strategy at the item level to maintain financial integrity.

## 🎨 UI Patterns

- **Stateless/Stateful Pattern**: Screens are split into a stateful entry point (handling ViewModel injection) and a stateless content block (handling UI layout). This facilitates easy integration with **Compose Previews** and simplifies unit testing.
- **CompositionLocal for Navigation**: Uses `LocalNavActions` to provide navigation callbacks (like `onBackClick` or `onViewBasketClick`) down the UI tree without prop-drilling. This simplifies deep UI hierarchies and makes components more reusable.
- **Material 3 Integration**: Leverages modern M3 components like `BadgedBox` for real-time basket count updates in the `TopAppBar`, providing clear visual feedback to the user.
- **Reactive UI Synchronization**: ViewModels leverage Kotlin `Flow` and the `combine` operator to merge remote data with local database streams. This ensures that UI elements like basket badges are updated in real-time across all screens (List, Details, Basket) using a single source of truth.
- **Efficient State Management**: Uses `stateIn` with `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000)` to keep data streams "warm" during configuration changes (like screen rotation) while avoiding unnecessary resource consumption when the app is in the background.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Screens like `ProductDetail` and `Basket` are designed with accessibility in mind, featuring fixed primary actions and scrollable content areas.

## ⚙️ Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**: Android Studio Ladybug (or newer)
2. **JDK**: Version 21
3. **Build**: Run `./gradlew assembleDebug`
4. **StrictMode**: Note that the app will crash in Debug mode if it detects network or disk operations on the main thread.
